# Next.js Link Component Navigation Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Next.js `Link` component.  The links render correctly on the page, but clicking them does not trigger the expected navigation.  This issue arises due to improper configuration or unintended interference from other parts of the application. The solution provided fixes this specific scenario, but similar issues can arise in various ways.

**Problem:** Links render but do not navigate.

**Solution:** Ensure the `Link` component is correctly integrated and that there aren't any conflicting JavaScript events that prevent default behavior.
